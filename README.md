## TODO

Recognize:
- [X] setup camera UI
- [X] save a frame from the stream
- [X] interface with caffe
- [X] initialize - find what is optimal FPS processing
- [X] recognition in progress indicator
- [ ] multiframe recognition using avg over scores
- [ ] calculate probability with bayes using prior probability of labels
- [ ] splash loading screen
- [ ] use accelerometer to find when it is appropriate to do processing
- [ ] direct loading of captured file by caffe, not via storing to sd card
- [ ] storing snapshots with probabilities
- [ ] caffe using GPU? (probably not going to happen)

Record:
- [ ] use accelerometer for recording
- [ ] add clock for recording
- [ ] check for available space before recording

Both:
- [ ] allow turning light on/off
- [ ] touch to focus camera
- [ ] create install procedure which checks for available space (needed to store snapshots and models)
- [ ] multi model support

Future:
- [ ] API calls for finding available models
- [ ] QR code reading for getting record/model info
- [Â ] GPS localization to get models automatically?
